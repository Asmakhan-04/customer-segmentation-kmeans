# customer-segmentation-kmeans
This project implements Customer Segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior. It helps businesses understand their customers better and target marketing strategies more effectively.

# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project applies unsupervised machine learning to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and characteristics. Using **K-Means Clustering**, it analyzes customer data (like annual income, spending score, etc.) to find meaningful clusters that can help in targeted marketing and personalization strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
- [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial) 
- Features: `CustomerID`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Annual Income`, `Spending Score`

## Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Elbow Method to determine optimal `k`
4. Applying K-Means Clustering
5. Visualizing customer segments

## Output
- Plots showing clusters
- Insight into customer categories (e.g., high spenders, low income, etc.)

## Outcome
This clustering model helps businesses:
- Personalize customer experience
- Improve marketing strategies
- Boost customer retention
